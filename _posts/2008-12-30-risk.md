  the odds of winning a particular dice roll? (like 3 dice vs. 2 dice, 3 dice vs.
  1 die, etc.)</li>\r\n\t<li>What are the odds of conquering a territory? (for example,
  20 men invading 17 men)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nAnyone who has played risk has an intuitive
  sense of the answers to the first question.  Odds of winning a 3 dice vs. 2 dice
  battle are about 50/50.  The invading army gets the advantage of an extra die, but
  ties go to the defender.  It turns out that these advantages roughly balance each
  other out.  (<a href=\"http://www.danallan.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/risk-single-engagement-odds.png\">Full
  results</a>.)\r\n\r\nQuestion #2 is harder because battles between a large number
  of soldiers are complicated.  It all comes down to who has to roll with a reduced
  number of dice.  For example, if a large army is cut down early with a string of
  bad luck, its odds of winning go down much faster."

I considered two questions about the board game [Risk](http://en.wikipedia.org/Risk_(game) "Wikipedia article").1. What are the odds of winning a particular dice roll? (like 3 dice vs. 2 dice, 3 dice vs. 1 die, etc.)
2. What are the odds of conquering a territory? (for example, 20 men invading 17 men)
Anyone who has played risk has an intuitive sense of the answers to the first question.  Odds of winning a 3 dice vs. 2 dice battle are about 50/50.  The invading army gets the advantage of an extra die, but ties go to the defender.  It turns out that these advantages roughly balance each other out.  ([Full results](http://www.danallan.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/risk-single-engagement-odds.png).)Question #2 is harder because battles between a large number of soldiers are complicated.  It all comes down to which player is forced to roll with a reduced number of dice.  For example, if a large army is cut down early with a string of bad luck, its odds of winning go down much faster.This table gives the odds of winning a whole series of dice rolls and **capturing a territory**.  The number of invading soldiers is along the side, defending soldiers along the top. Their corresponding entry gives the invaders' odds of wiping out the defending army.[caption id="attachment_513" align="aligncenter" width="499" caption="Click to enlarge!"][![Click to enlarge!](http://www.danallan.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/risk-conquest-odds-499x229.png "risk-conquest-odds")](http://www.danallan.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/risk-conquest-odds.png)[/caption]Only the truly dedicated would want to memorize some of this. But the top-left corner gives us a feel for how typical situations will likely play out.Some footnotes:- Of course there is never a 100% probability of success.  I round to 100% when the probability is greater than 99.5%.
- This table considers up to 20 soldiers, but it could easily be extended.
- It's obvious that more soldiers = better odds.  But following along the diagonals reveals interesting features. Notice how 2 vs. 1 is better than 3 vs. 2 but not as good as 4 vs. 3.
- To generate this table I computed 3 800 000 simulated conquests (10 000 per entry) and tabulated their outcomes in _Mathematica_.
**Previous Work. **There is a web [article](http://www.recreationalmath.com/Risk/RiskPaper.doc "Word document") by Daniel C. Taflin (2001) that considers Question #1 and explains the underlying mathematics of his approach in detail.******Other important life lessons.** Alliances are made to be broken; Asia is weak; never leave Australia unattended.
